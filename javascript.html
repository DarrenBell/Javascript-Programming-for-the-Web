	<h1>JavaScript stuff</h1>
		<p>Variables - Variables give data a name (such as x + y).</p>
		<p>In JavaScript, we create a variable by using the keyword var and specifying the name we want to use: 
		<br />var chameleon;<br />
        This is called <strong>declaring</strong> a variable.</p>
		<p>Assignment Operator (=).</p>
		<p>Change a variable later without using var, ie chameleon = red.</p>
		<p>$ and _ only non-alphanumeric characters allowed.</p>
		<p>Variables are case sensitive.</p>
		<p>Standard practice to create variables in lower case.</p>
		<p>Variables can't have spaces, use underscores or camel casing without underscores RedChameleon.</p>
		<p>Variables can hold numbers (whole and decimal), anything else, strings, words etc.</p>
		<p>+, -, / and * are called operators.</p>
		<p>Bracketed equations get calculated first, 4+6*8 is different to (4+6)*8</p>
		<p>+= 1(number) is add and assign.</p>
		<p>++ add 1(number) and set as new var value.</p>
		<p>-- minus 1(number) and set as new var value.</p>
		<p>-= 8(number) is minusing 8 from var (ie 27) and assigning it to new value (ie 21).</p>
		<p>Strings can be single or double quotes.</p>
		<p>Escape the quote marks by using \ (backslash). This is used if you use singles in a single or doubles in a double. It works fine with singles in a double or doubles in a single.</p>
		<p>Concatenate (+) strings together, var complete = "com" + "plete"; becomes "complete".</p>
		<p>Booleans are true of false.</p>
		<p>True and False are keywords, quotes not necessary.</p>
		<p>Group of data stored using arrays</p>
		<p>Arrays created using square brackets []</p>
		<p>Each array slot is called an element</p>
		<p>Referencing an element using the index, which starts at 0.</p>
		<p>Index represents position in array.</p>
		<p>Arrays contain any data type</p>
		<p>Variable length found using .length on end of variable. array.length will return number of elements in array. To get last element in array you would type array.length - 1</p>
		<p>Instead of a semicolon, an if statement ends with the conditional code between curly braces {}</p>
		<p>Conditional statements end up being Boolean (true or false)</p>
		<p>Most useful conditional statements contain comparison operators</p>
		<p>Greater than ( > )</p>
		<p>Less than ( < ) </p>
		<p>equality (==)</p>
		<p>inequality (!=)</p>
		<p>Each comparison operator calculates what's on the left and compares with what is on the right to determine whether it is true or false.</p>
		<p>
		Here are the most commonly used comparison operators, and the results they’ll return with different values:

			> (greater than)

			Example: A > B

			true if A is greater than B

			>= (greater than or equal)
			
			Example: A >= B
			
			true if A is greater than or equal to B
			
			< (less than)
			
			Example: A < B
			
			true if A is less than B
			
			<= (less than or equal)
			
			Example: A <= B
			
			true if A is less than or equal to B
			
			== (equal)
			
			Example: A == B
			
			true if A equals B
			
			!= (not equal)
			
			Example: A != B
			
			true if A does not equal B
			
			! (not)
			
			Example: !A
			
			true if A’s Boolean value is false
		</p>
		<p>Multiple Conditions - Instead of using just one test as a condition, you can create a whole chain of them using the logical operators AND ( && ) and OR ( || )</p>
		<p>AND means both must evaluate to TRUE for the whole expression to evaluate to TRUE, OR means one must evaluate to TRUE for the whole expression to evalute to TRUE.</p>
